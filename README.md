## About me 👋
I am a programmer with a decade of programming experience under my belt, alongside 4 years of industry experience! I love putting my ideas into reality in game engines like Unity, Godot & Roblox Studio. 🖥️
When out of the house, I enjoy lifting weights and jogging. My favourite sport has to be baseball.
I don't bite!
